# advent-of-code-python

My Python solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 

Please note that the solutions I ultimately make available here are not necessarily the solution I
write in the moment. I do my best to solve each problem as fast as I can for the leaderboards (like
that's ever going to happen), which I will then clean up and/or rewrite into a better state.

## How to run
