# advent-of-code-python

My Python solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 

Please note that the solutions I make available here are likely not the solutions I wrote in the
moment of solving the problem for the first time. I do my best to solve each problem as fast as I
can for the leaderboards (like that's ever going to happen), which I will then clean up and/or
rewrite into a better state.
