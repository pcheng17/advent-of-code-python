## Thoughts

### Day 1

Wow, I'm rusty, but the problem was very straightforward. Reading comprehension already messed me up
today - I missed the fact that part a needed to be sorted. Part b was just a lot of tripping over
off-by-one errors. Regardless, easy day! A nice way to get back into the AoC mindset.

### Day 2

Yep, really rusty. I struggled a lot on syntax in this problem, like trying to figure out the
Pythonic way of finding the delta between pairs of adjacent elements. Then in part b, I completely
messed up the logic. I was trying to use some of the work done in part a, but very incorrectly. At
the end of the day, I just chose to create a new list for every removed element to see if the row is
safe upon removing one element. I also forgot the correct Python notation here, so I ended up with a
really brute-force way of popping elements.
