## Thoughts

### Day 1

Wow, I'm rusty, but the problem was very straightforward. Reading comprehension already messed me up
today - I missed the fact that part a needed to be sorted. Part b was just a lot of tripping over
off-by-one errors. Regardless, easy day! A nice way to get back into the AoC mindset.

### Day 2

Yep, really rusty. I struggled a lot on syntax in this problem, like trying to figure out the
Pythonic way of finding the delta between pairs of adjacent elements. Then in part b, I completely
messed up the logic. I was trying to use some of the work done in part a, but very incorrectly. At
the end of the day, I just chose to create a new list for every removed element to see if the row is
safe upon removing one element. I also forgot the correct Python notation here, so I ended up with a
really brute-force way of popping elements.

### Day 3

The problem itself was fine. I just got completely screwed over because I always immediately split
my input at the newlines, thinking that each row of the input file is a new piece of data to
process. Woops, not the case this time...

Knowing a tiny bit of regex saved me this time, too. I remember I really struggled with regex last
year.
